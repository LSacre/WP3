  abstract = {The importance of microbial root inhabitants for plant growth and health was recognized as early as 100 years ago. Recent insights reveal a close symbiotic relationship between plants and their associated microorganisms, and high structural and functional diversity within plant microbiomes. Plants provide microbial communities with specific habitats, which can be broadly categorized as the rhizosphere, phyllosphere, and endosphere. Plant-associated microbes interact with their host in essential functional contexts. They can stimulate germination and growth, help plants fend off disease, promote stress resistance, and influence plant fitness. Therefore, plants have to be considered as metaorganisms within which the associated microbes usually outnumber the cells belonging to the plant host. The structure of the plant microbiome is determined by biotic and abiotic factors but follows ecological rules. Metaorganisms are co-evolved species assemblages. The metabolism and morphology of plants and their microbiota are intensively connected with each other, and the interplay of both maintains the functioning and fitness of the holobiont. Our study of the current literature shows that analysis of plant microbiome data has brought about a paradigm shift in our understanding of the diverse structure and functioning of the plant microbiome with respect to the following: (i) the high interplay of bacteria, archaea, fungi, and protists; (ii) the high specificity even at cultivar level; (iii) the vertical transmission of core microbiomes; (iv) the extraordinary function of endophytes; and (v) several unexpected functions and metabolic interactions. The plant microbiome should be recognized as an additional factor in experimental botany and breeding strategies.},

Rapid advances in multi-omics tools are dramatically increasing access to the plant microbiome and consequently to the identification of its links with diseases and to the control of those diseases. Recent insights reveal a close, often symbiotic relationship between microorganisms and plants. Microorganisms can stimulate germination and plant growth, prevent diseases, and promote stress resistance and general fitness. Plants and their associated microorganisms form a holobiont and have to be considered as co-evolved species assemblages consisting of bacterial, archaeal and diverse eukaryotic species. The beneficial interplay of the host and its microbiome is responsible for maintaining the health of the holobiont, while diseases are often correlated with microbial dysbioses. Microbial diversity was identified as a key factor in preventing diseases and can be implemented as a biomarker in plant protection strategies. Targeted and predictive biocontrol approaches are possible by developing microbiome-based solutions. Moreover, combined breeding and biocontrol strategies maintaining diversity and ecosystem health are required. The analysis of plant microbiome data has brought about a paradigm shift in our understanding of its role in health and disease and has substantial consequences for biocontrol and health issues.},

We observed increased effector gene expression in response to biotic interactions, particularly with plants, indicating their importance in host colonization. Some effectors responded to both plants and microbes, suggesting dual roles in intermicrobial competition and plant--microbe interactions. A subset of putative antimicrobial effectors, including a GH18-CBM5 chitinase, was induced exclusively by microbes. Functional analyses of this chitinase revealed its antimicrobial and plant-protective properties.

Using genetic and metabolomic approaches, we identified the antimicrobial 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol~(DAPG) and the iron chelator pyoverdine as exometabolites whose combined functions explain most of the inhibitory activity of the strongly antagonistic Pseudomonas brassicacearum R401. Microbiota reconstitution with a core of Arabidopsis thaliana root commensals in the presence of wild-type or mutant strains revealed a root niche-specific cofunction of these exometabolites as root competence determinants and drivers of predictable changes in the root-associated community. In natural environments, both the corresponding biosynthetic operons are enriched in roots, a pattern likely linked to their role as iron sinks, indicating that these cofunctioning exometabolites are adaptive traits contributing to pseudomonad pervasiveness throughout the root microbiota.},

Protonemata (gametophytes) of the moss Funaria hygrometrica were cultivated in vitro under axenic conditions and the growth of the protonemal filaments recorded. In the presence of methylobacteria (different strains of Methylobacterium), average cell length and the number of cells per filament were both enhanced. We tested the hypothesis that auxin (indole-3-acetic acid, IAA), secreted by the epiphytic bacteria and taken up by the plant cells, may in part be responsible for this promotion of protonema development. The antiauxin parachlorophenoxyisobutyric acid (PCIB) was used as a tool to analyze the role of IAA and methylobacteria in the regulation of cell growth. In the presence of PCIB, cell elongation and protonema differentiation were both inhibited. This effect was compensated for by the addition of different Methylobacterium strains to the culture medium. Biosynthesis and secretion of IAA by methylobacteria maintained in liquid culture was documented via a colorimetric assay and thin layer chromatography. Our results support the hypothesis that the development of Funaria protonemata is promoted by beneficial phytohormone-producing methylobacteria, which can be classified as phytosymbionts.},

However, disentangling the precise factors that determine recruitment success in species that critically rely on mycorrhizal fungi represents a major challenge. In this study, we used seed germination experiments, 454 amplicon pyrosequencing and assessment of soil conditions to investigate the factors driving changes in local abundance in 28 populations of the orchid Neottia ovata. Comparison of population sizes measured in 2003 and 2013 showed that nearly 60\% of the studied populations had declined in size (average growth rate across all populations: -0.01). Investigation of the mycorrhizal fungi in both the roots and soil revealed a total of 68 species of putatively mycorrhizal fungi, 21 of which occurred exclusively in roots, 25 that occurred solely in soil and 22 that were observed in both the soil and roots. Seed germination was limited and significantly and positively related to soil moisture content and soil pH, but not to fungal community composition. Large populations or populations with high population growth rates showed significantly higher germination than small populations or populations declining in size, but no significant relationships were found between population size or growth and mycorrhizal diversity. Overall, these results indicate that temporal changes in abundance were related to the ability of seeds to germinate, but at the same time they provided limited evidence that variation in fungal communities played an important role in determining population dynamics.},

  abstract = {It has long been thought that the life cycle of Streptomyces bacteria encompasses three developmental stages: vegetative hyphae, aerial hyphae and spores. Here, we show interactions between Streptomyces and fungi trigger a previously unobserved mode of Streptomyces development. We term these Streptomyces cells `explorers', for their ability to adopt a non-branching vegetative hyphal conformation and rapidly transverse solid surfaces. Fungi trigger Streptomyces exploratory growth in part by altering the composition of the growth medium, and Streptomyces explorer cells can communicate this exploratory behaviour to other physically separated streptomycetes using an airborne volatile organic compound (VOC). These results reveal that interkingdom interactions can trigger novel developmental behaviours in bacteria, here, causing Streptomyces to deviate from its classically-defined life cycle. Furthermore, this work provides evidence that VOCs can act as long-range communication signals capable of propagating microbial morphological switches., DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21738.001, Soil is home to many bacteria. In fact, soil gets it characteristic `earthy' smell from a common type of soil bacteria known as Streptomyces. Remarkably, Streptomyces are also the original sources of most of the antibiotics that are prescribed by doctors to treat bacterial infections. Scientists have been studying Streptomyces for over 70 years, and in all this time, there has been unanimous agreement on how these bacteria grow. That is to say that, unlike most other bacteria, Streptomyces grow like plants: they don't move, and instead produce spores that are dispersed like seeds. This stationary lifestyle makes these bacteria somewhat vulnerable to predators, and so it is thought that Streptomyces make antibiotics to help protect themselves from other bacteria that are able to move around in the soil., However, this established view of Streptomyces growth has now been turned on its head because Jones et al. have discovered that Streptomyces bacteria can indeed move when grown in the presence of fungi. Specifically, when a species of Streptomyces is grown with yeast, some of the bacteria start to explore their environment, move over top of other bacteria and up hard surfaces to heights that would be the equivalent of humans scaling Mount Everest., Unexpectedly, Jones et al. also found that these ``explorer'' Steptomyces can communicate with nearby Streptomyces bacteria with a perfume-like airborne signal and convince their relatives to begin exploring too. Furthermore, while this volatile signal promotes the growth of Streptomyces, it adversely affects other bacteria and makes them sicker such that they are less able to grow and survive., Together these findings reveal new ways that bacteria and other microbes can interact and communicate with each other. They also emphasise that researchers will need to consider such long-range communication strategies if they hope to better understand microbial communities., DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21738.002},

We hypothesized that bacterium-bacterium antagonistic interactions may contribute to variations in community structure at the microscale. We examined each of the 86 isolates for their inhibition of growth of the remaining 85 isolates by the Burkholder agar diffusion assay. More than one-half of the isolates expressed antagonistic activity, and this trait was more common with particle-associated bacteria than with free-living bacteria. This was exemplified by members of the {$\alpha$} subclass of the class               Proteobacteria               ({$\alpha$}-proteobacteria), in which production of antagonistic molecules was dominated by attached bacteria. We found that {$\gamma$}-proteobacteria (members of the orders               Alteromonadales               and               Vibrionales               ) are the most prolific producers of inhibitory materials and also the most resilient to them, while members of the               Bacteriodetes               were the organisms that were least productive and most sensitive to antagonistic interactions. Widespread interspecies growth inhibition is consistent with the role of this phenomenon in structuring bacterial communities at the microscale. Furthermore, our results suggest that bacteria from pelagic marine particles may be an underutilized source of novel antibiotics.},

The beneficial effects of these rhizobacteria on plant growth can be direct or indirect. This review begins with describing the conditions under which bacteria live in the rhizosphere. To exert their beneficial effects, bacteria usually must colonize the root surface efficiently. Therefore, bacterial traits required for root colonization are subsequently described. Finally, several mechanisms by which microbes can act beneficially on plant growth are described. Examples of direct plant growth promotion that are discussed include (a) biofertilization, (b) stimulation of root growth, (c) rhizoremediation, and (d ) plant stress control. Mechanisms of biological control by which rhizobacteria can promote plant growth indirectly, i.e., by reducing the level of disease, include antibiosis, induction of systemic resistance, and competition for nutrients and niches.},

Sometimes overlooked are their varying additional roles that include serving as metabolic intermediaries, playing structural roles in bioactive natural products, acting as cosubstrates in enzymatic transformations, and as key regulators of cellular physiology. Amino acids can also serve as biological sources of both carbon and nitrogen and are found in the rhizosphere as a result of lysis or cellular efflux from plants and microbes and proteolysis of existing peptides. While both plants and microbes apparently prefer to take up nitrogen in its inorganic form, their ability to take up and use amino acids may confer a selective advantage in certain environments where organic nitrogen is abundant. Further, certain amino acids (e.g., glutamate and proline) and their betaines (e.g., glycine betaine) serve as compatible solutes necessary for osmoregulation in plants and microbes and can undergo rapid cellular flux. This ability is of particular importance in an ecological niche such as the rhizosphere, which is prone to significant variations in solute concentrations. Amino acids are also shown to alter key phenotypes related to plant root growth and microbial colonization, symbiotic interactions, and pathogenesis in the rhizosphere.

Plants coexist with microorganisms, which play a significant role in influencing their growth and functional traits. The rhizosphere serves as an ecological niche encompassing plant roots and is a chemically complex environment that supports the growth and development of diverse plant-interactive microbes. Although plant-microbe interactions have been extensively investigated however, limited exploration have been made how abiotic stresses affect the structure and assembly of microbial communities in the rhizosphere. This review highlights climate change influence on plant growth, functional traits, and microbial communities. It explores plant mechanisms for mitigating abiotic stress, such as removing reactive oxygen species (ROS), regulating antioxidant activity and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production, and controlling growth-inhibitory ethylene levels through colonization by bacteria producing ACC deaminase. Additionally, we elaborated the systematic communicatory network steered by hormonal crosstalk and root exudation, which can modulate and initiate the dialogues between plants and surrounding microbes. This network ultimately promotes the chemotactic movement of microbes towards the rhizosphere, facilitating their early colonization. Finally, we reviewed the recent advancements for understanding how plant-microbe interactions foster resilience under climate stress.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Abiotic stresses arising from climate change negates crop growth and yield, leading to food insecurity. Drought causes oxidative stress on plants, arising from excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) due to inadequate CO2, which disrupts the photosynthetic machinery of plants. The use of conventional methods for the development of drought-tolerant crops is time-consuming, and the full adoption of modern biotechnology for crop enhancement is still regarded with prudence. Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) could be used as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly approach for enhancing crop growth under environmental stress. The various direct and indirect mechanisms used for plant growth enhancement by PGPR were discussed. Synthesis of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase enhances plant nutrient uptake by breaking down plant ACC, thereby preventing ethylene accumulation, and enable plants to tolerate water stress. The exopolysaccharides produced also improves the ability of the soil to withhold water. PGPR enhances osmolyte production, which is effective in reducing the detrimental effects of ROS. Multifaceted PGPRs are potential candidates for biofertilizer production to lessen the detrimental effects of drought stress on crops cultivated in arid regions. This review proffered ways of augmenting their efficacy as bio-inoculants under field conditions and highlighted future prospects for sustainable agricultural productivity.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Plants host a mesmerizing diversity of microbes inside and around their roots, known as the microbiome. The microbiome is composed mostly of fungi, bacteria, oomycetes, and archaea that can be either pathogenic or beneficial for plant health and fitness. To grow healthy, plants need to surveil soil niches around the roots for the detection of pathogenic microbes, and in parallel maximize the services of beneficial microbes in nutrients uptake and growth promotion. Plants employ a palette of mechanisms to modulate their microbiome including structural modifications, the exudation of secondary metabolites and the coordinated action of different defence responses. Here, we review the current understanding on the composition and activity of the root microbiome and how different plant molecules can shape the structure of the root-associated microbial communities. Examples are given on interactions that occur in the rhizosphere between plants and soilborne fungi. We also present some well-established examples of microbiome harnessing to highlight how plants can maximize their fitness by selecting their microbiome. Understanding how plants manipulate their microbiome can aid in the design of next-generation microbial inoculants for targeted disease suppression and enhanced plant growth.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Global change is a defining feature of the Anthropocene, the current human-dominated epoch, and poses imminent threats to ecosystem dynamics and services such as plant productivity, biodiversity, and environmental regulation. In this era, terrestrial ecosystems are experiencing perturbations linked to direct habitat modifications as well as indirect effects of global change on species distribution and extreme abiotic conditions. Microorganisms represent an important reservoir of biodiversity that can influence macro-organisms as they face habitat loss, rising atmospheric CO2 concentration, pollution, global warming, and increased frequency of drought. Plant-microbe interactions in the phyllosphere have been shown to support plant growth and increase host resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we review how plant-microbe interactions in the phyllosphere can influence host survival and fitness in the context of global change. We highlight evidence that plant-microbe interactions (1) improve urban pollution remediation through the degradation of pollutants such as ultrafine particulate matter, black carbon, and atmospheric hydrocarbons, (2) have contrasting impacts on plant species range shifts through the loss of symbionts or pathogens, and (3) drive plant host adaptation to drought and warming. Finally, we discuss how key community ecology processes could drive plant-microbe interactions facing challenges of the Anthropocene.},

  abstract = {The plant microbiota consists of a multitude of microorganisms that can affect plant health and fitness. However, it is currently unclear how the plant shapes its leaf microbiota and what role the plant immune system plays in this process. Here, we evaluated Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with defects in different parts of the immune system for an altered bacterial community assembly using a gnotobiotic system. While higher-order mutants in receptors that recognize microbial features and in defence hormone signalling showed substantial microbial community alterations, the absence of the plant NADPH oxidase RBOHD caused the most pronounced change in the composition of the leaf microbiota. The rbohD knockout resulted in an enrichment of specific bacteria. Among these, we identified Xanthomonas strains as opportunistic pathogens that colonized wild-type plants asymptomatically but caused disease in rbohD knockout plants. Strain dropout experiments revealed that the lack of RBOHD unlocks the pathogenicity of individual microbiota members driving dysbiosis in rbohD knockout plants. For full protection, healthy plants require both a functional immune system and a microbial community. Our results show that the NADPH oxidase RBOHD is essential for microbiota homeostasis and emphasizes the importance of the plant immune system in controlling the leaf microbiota.},

  abstract = {Plants have coevolved together with the microbes that surround them and this assemblage of host and microbes functions as a discrete ecological unit called a holobiont. This review outlines plant-driven assembly of diseasesuppressive microbiomes. Plants are colonized by microbes from seed, soil, and air but selectively shape the microbiome with root exudates, creating microenvironment hot spots where microbes thrive. Using plant immunity for gatekeeping and surveillance, host-plant genetic properties govern microbiome assembly and can confer adaptive advantages to the holobiont. These advantages manifest in disease-suppressive soils, where buildup of specific microbes inhibits the causal agent of disease, that typically develop after an initial disease outbreak. Based on disease-suppressive soils such as take-all decline, we developed a conceptual model of how plants in response to pathogen attack cry for help and recruit plant-protective microbes that confer increased resistance. Thereby, plants create a soilborne legacy that protects subsequent generations and forms disease-suppressive soils.},

  abstract = {Plants deposit photosynthetically-fixed carbon in the rhizosphere, the thin soil layer directly around the root, thereby creating a hospitable environment for microbes. To manage the inhabitants of this nutrient-rich environment, plant roots exude and dynamically adjust microbe-attracting and -repelling compounds to stimulate specific members of the microbiome. Previously, we demonstrated that foliar infection of Arabidopsis thaliana by the biotrophic downy mildew pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) leads to a disease-induced modification of the rhizosphere microbiome. Soil conditioned with Hpa-infected plants provided enhanced protection against foliar downy mildew infection in a subsequent population of plants, a phenomenon dubbed the soil-borne legacy (SBL). Here, we show that for the creation of the SBL, plant-produced coumarins play a prominent role as coumarin-deficient myb72 and f6'h1 mutants were defective in creating a Hpa-induced SBL. Root exudation profiles changed significantly in Col-0 upon foliar Hpa infection, and this was accompanied by a compositional shift in the root microbiome that was significantly different from microbial shifts occurring on roots of Hpa-infected coumarin-deficient mutants. Our data further show that the Hpa-induced SBL primes Col-0 plants growing in SBL-conditioned soil for salicylic acid (SA)-dependent defenses. The SA-signaling mutants sid2 and npr1 were unresponsive to the Hpa-induced SBL, suggesting that the protective effect of the Hpa-induced shift in the root microbiome results from an induced systemic resistance that requires SA-signaling in the plant.},

  abstract = {Streptomyces bacteria are ubiquitous in soils and are well known for producing secondary metabolites, including antimicrobials. Increasingly, they are being isolated from plant roots, and several studies have shown they are specifically recruited to the rhizosphere and the endosphere of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we test the hypothesis that Streptomyces bacteria have a beneficial effect on A. thaliana growth and could potentially be used as plant probiotics. To do this, we selectively isolated streptomycetes from surface-washed A. thaliana roots and generated high-quality genome sequences for five strains, which we named L2, M2, M3, N1, and N2. Reinfection of A. thaliana plants with L2, M2, and M3 significantly increased plant biomass individually and in combination, whereas N1 and N2 had a negative effect on plant growth, likely due to their production of polyene natural products which can bind to phytosterols and reduce plant growth. N2 exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and makes filipin-like polyenes, including 14-hydroxyisochainin which inhibits the take-all fungus, Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici. N2 antifungal activity as a whole was upregulated {$\sim$}2-fold in response to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), suggesting a possible role during competition in the rhizosphere. Furthermore, coating wheat seeds with N2 spores protected wheat seedlings against take-all disease. We conclude that at least some soil-dwelling streptomycetes confer growth-promoting benefits on A. thaliana, while others might be exploited to protect crops against disease. IMPORTANCE We must reduce reliance on agrochemicals, and there is increasing interest in using bacterial strains to promote plant growth and protect against disease. Our study follows up reports that Arabidopsis thaliana specifically recruits Streptomyces bacteria to its roots. We test the hypotheses that they offer benefits to their A. thaliana hosts and that strains isolated from these plants might be used as probiotics. We isolated Streptomyces strains from A. thaliana roots and genome sequenced five phylogenetically distinct strains. Genome mining and bioassays indicated that all five have plant growth-promoting properties, including production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), siderophores, and aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase. Three strains significantly increased A. thaliana growth in vitro and in combination in soil. Another produces potent filipin-like antifungals and protected germinating wheat seeds against the fungal pathogen Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (wheat take-all fungus). We conclude that introducing Streptomyces strains into the root microbiome provides significant benefits to plants.},

These myriad microorganisms are robustly intertwined with their hosts and can determine plant fate by influencing fitness and growth or offering protection from detrimental bacteria, fungi, and herbivores. Recent studies have revealed significant effects of host genome diversity on plant-microbiome assembly and how host genetics determine microbiome composition, which is crucial for beneficial functions. The few host loci identified through genome-wide association studies suggest that genes involved in plant development, immunity, nutrient uptake, and root exudates regulate plant-microbiome community structure.
